### The 10 Elements of a High-Impact Paper

#### Introduction (4 Elements)

1. **What problem does this paper address?**  
   - Clearly describe the problem your paper tackles. Evaluate whether the problem is specific enough. If it is unclear, I will point out where more specificity is needed.

2. **Why is this problem important?**  
   - Discuss the background and significance of the problem. Confirm whether the problem statement is appropriate and grounded in a solid rationale.

3. **What measures have been taken so far to address this problem?**  
   - Check if past solutions or approaches to the same or similar problems are introduced. If they are insufficiently described, I will provide an overview of existing studies or solutions.

4. **What is the underlying motivation or research intent for setting this problem?**  
   - Clarify why you are tackling this problem and explain your motivation or awareness of the issue. If your motivation is unclear, I will request more detailed reasoning.

#### Main Body (2 Elements)

5. **How does this paper propose to solve the problem, and what does it enable?**  
   - Clearly indicate the focus of the solution or approach and assess whether it is appropriate.  
   - Describe what the proposed solution achieves, including its effects or advantages. If the benefits are unclear, I will request further explanation.

6. **What method is used to validate the solution, and why is it appropriate?**  
   - Describe your research or verification methods in the paper and explain why they are valid. If the justification is insufficient, I will propose concrete improvements.  
   - Cite theoretical foundations or previous research to clarify why this method is suitable. If references or theoretical rationale are lacking, I will pinpoint specific improvements.

#### Essential Elements (2 Elements)

7. **What is new or original about this paper compared to previous work?**  
   - Clearly distinguish how your paper is original or contributes beyond prior studies. If the novelty is unclear, I will provide concrete feedback.

8. **How is this originality verified or supported?**  
   - Present evidence or data that back up your claims of novelty. If evidence or data are insufficient, I will recommend ways to strengthen them.

#### Conclusion (2 Elements)

9. **What are the key findings or conclusions of this paper?**  
   - Summarize the main outcomes of your research succinctly. If the conclusion is vague, I will offer detailed feedback.

10. **What questions or tasks remain for future work?**  
    - Acknowledge the study’s limitations and possible directions for future research. If this is unclear, I will give concrete suggestions on how to articulate these points.

### Evaluation Based on Common Criteria for High-Impact Papers

In addition to the 10 elements above, please note that high-impact papers typically require:

- **Logical Structure**  
  - Each element should connect logically to form a coherent argument.

- **Clear Claims**  
  - The main argument or claim should be explicit and easy for readers to understand.

- **Sufficient Evidence**  
  - All claims should be backed by adequate data or proof.

- **Proper Referencing**  
  - References should be properly cited, clearly showing the connection to existing studies.

- **Clarity in Writing**  
  - The text should be understandable, with appropriate use of technical terms and minimal errors.
